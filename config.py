Agent: Hello, this is a reminder call from ABC Finance. This call is being recorded for quality and compliance purposes.

Customer: Yeah, I know, you people keep calling me again and again. I’m already stressed.

Agent: I understand your concern, sir. Before we proceed, please note that this is not a legal notice, only a payment reminder.

Customer: Fine, go on.

Agent: As per our records, your personal loan account ending with 7832 shows an overdue amount of thirty two thousand five hundred rupees.

Customer: That’s not correct. I already paid something last month.

Agent: Yes sir, a payment of five thousand rupees was received on January 10th, but the remaining balance is still pending.

Customer: Look, my salary was delayed and then my wife had surgery, so things got really bad financially.

Agent: I’m sorry to hear that. The current interest rate on your loan is eight point seven five percent, and there is also a late payment charge of two thousand rupees.

Customer: That’s exactly why I’m upset. The amount keeps increasing every time I talk to someone.

Agent: I understand. To help you avoid further penalties, we’d like to set up a payment arrangement.

Customer: Okay, listen carefully. I can pay ten thousand today if my friend sends me the money.

Agent: Alright.

Customer: Then maybe another seven or eight thousand sometime next week, not sure about the exact date.

Agent: And the remaining balance?

Customer: I’ll try to clear everything before the end of this month, but I’m not promising anything right now.

Agent: Sir, we’ll need at least one confirmed date.

Customer: Fine. Put it like this — I will pay at least fifteen thousand rupees by the 25th, and after that we can talk again.

Agent: Thank you for confirming. Just to repeat, this call is being recorded and the details discussed may be used for internal records.

Customer: Yeah, yeah, I understand.

Agent: Do you acknowledge the outstanding balance and the payment plan discussed?

Customer: I acknowledge the balance, but I still want a statement because I feel some charges are incorrect.

Agent: We can email you the statement. Is your registered email still the same?

Customer: Yes, it hasn’t changed.

Agent: Thank you. We’ll note this commitment and follow up accordingly.

Customer: Please don’t call me daily. It makes things worse.

Agent: I understand, sir. We’ll update the notes.

Customer: Okay.
Agent: Thank you for your time. Have a good day.
